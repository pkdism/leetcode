"""
Given an array of citations sorted in ascending order (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, 
write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.
According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: 
"A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, 
and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."
